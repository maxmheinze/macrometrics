# macrometrics

This repository contains work on the assignments from Course No. 4423, Advanced Macroeconometrics. The structure of the repository within each assignment sub-folder is as follows:

* `code` contains intermediate `R` code files and `Rmd` files prepared for submission.
* `data` contains the data and other files used to complete the respective assignment.
* `output` contains outputs like csv files, plots, etc., to be used in the submission.

## Note to Instructors

The assignment sub-folder contains `.R` scripts as well as the `.Rmd` file along with the PDF generated from it, which is the same as the one we submitted through Canvas. The code in the `.R` files should be up-to-date with the `.Rmd`, but in case there are differences, the `.Rmd` is the more recent version.
